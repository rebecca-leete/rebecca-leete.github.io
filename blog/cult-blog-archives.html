                    Success is not just about your practical skills and knowledge. And this 
                    is not just about success. This looks at the importance of understanding 
                    yourself and others, and being able to artfully hold the relationship between 
                    both of these understandings.

                  Process is about patience. It's about trusting that the work you're 
                  doing is going to pay off in the long term, instead of focussing on 
                  great results short-term. I really like this because I think it reflects 
                  a really healthy attitude to life in general, and one that I 
                  do my best to practice: placing my self-worth in my efforts and intention 
                  rather than my outcomes. Because we're always learning!

                I've known about mindfulness for a while. But really, I am only just starting 
                to understand how it can unlock a person. Here I explore on how to integrate 
                mindfulness into everyday life, and reflect on how it can change attitudes of 
                success and failure, and consequently transform ideas of self-worth and ability. 
                Search inside yourself indeed!

              Self confidence is not about making yourself into such a great person 
              that you trust youtrself to act desirably in any situation. It is about 
              acknowledging and making peace with your insecurites. There's a Buddhist 
              premise that says that we can only desire things we do not already have, 
              and I think in that lies the secret path to all things of the self: confidence, 
              love, trust, etc... In accepting ourselves the way we are, we are actually 
              free to be the best version of ourselves. Wow!

            Like coding, it's one thing to cultivate good emotions - but it's another 
            thing entirely to deal capably and calmly with problems when they arise. 
            It's really interesting to explore the dark side of our emotional self 
            through things like triggers, and if it's done from a place of stability and 
            curiosity, it's definitely where the most kearning happens too.

          My favourite one so far!! Looking at motivation allows us to explore the 
          deeper parts of ourselves, the grand and fantastical things that are in our 
          hearts and our inner child. I am glad purpose was acknowledged in this chapter, 
          as I see the sense purpose as possibly <em>the</em> most powerful source of motivation 
          known to man, and it is often not explored fully because the modern-western world 
          loves to involve itself in matters of the mind over matters of the heart. A thoroughly 
          enriching exercise!
