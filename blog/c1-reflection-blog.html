  <p> Here we go, down the rabbit hole. I discovered Dev through a couple Enspiralites that I am privileged to call friends. I loved the way they talked, the way they worked, the way they saw and engaged with the world. Last year I realised web development was something I wanted to do because
  </p>
<p>A). the money was substantially better than my part-time work
</p>
  <p>B). the working hours and location could be totally flexible, and I was captivated by this idea of the digital nomad
  </p>
<p>C). Having a passion for social and community development, I had seen many many people and groups doing incredible work, but not able to reach an audience. I felt like web development was a versatile and relevant skill to be able to contribute to these groups, and I was curious about exploring it as a non-monetary currency to use while travelling
</p>
<p>and D). I felt like I had a lot of great people skills, but no practical industry to ground them in, and web dev seemed like an increasingly relevant industry around the world, and I was keen to dive into this world and see how I could use my soft skills to help create a healthy and ethical work culture around me
</p>
<p>All of this came mentally crashing down on me in one realisation last winter, and I signed up within a fortnight. Little did I know, I had just entered a space owning one of the most healthy and ethical work cultures I have ever experienced.Every interaction I took part in was positive, considerate and empathetic. I was taken aback by the relentlessly welcoming people I dealt with, the absolute art they had made communication into, the seamless way tikanga and te reo maori had been integrated into the course and ethos,and the constant invitations to own and co-create my own experience here. All. So. FASCINATING! I love this stuff!! </p>
