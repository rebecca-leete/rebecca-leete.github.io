        Grid-based Design!
      </h3>
      <p class="page-content">
        Grid-based design is simultaneously one of the basic and master tools of 
        any web-dev. It's a way of splitting up the webpage into a series of rows,
         spanning the length of the page, and within these rows dividing the space 
        into columns, effectively creating a chess board of options for you to lay 
        out your content.

        Why responsive webpages are gold
      </h3>
      <p class="page-content">
         The extent and nature of the internet's accessibility has grown drastica
         lly in the last 10 years or so. No longer is it only reached through a 
         chunky PC and noisy dial up. Here and now, people are connected to the in
         ternet almost continuously, through all sorts of devices - PCs, laptops, 
         notebooks, tablets, smart phones. The great thing about responsive webpages 
         is that they are designed to have flexible display options so that they look 
         great and work well on so many different screen sizes. Responsive webpages 
         are worth looking into because they enable the developer to choose which 
         elements stay on the page and where, whilst maintaining a professional 
         aesthetic and smooth user interface.

        Semantic Structure
      </h3>
      <p class="page-content">
        In html, as we know, we have tags to divide and define the different elements
         in a webpage. The word semantic, in linguistics (BA student hollaa), literal
         ly just means "meaning." It transfers pretty well in html - semantic structu
         re simply refers to the practice of organising your page elements by tags 
         that actually <strong>define</strong> the content. Instead of using generic 
         tags like <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace"><strong>div</strong></span> 
         and class, we can use specific tags such as <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace"><strong>header, nav, footer, article,</strong></span>
          etc.
