        <p>
            I haven't had the chance to implement any of the habits and behaviours I've just explored, but they were fascinating, and I've put a note in my diary to consider it and set some solid intentions in place before the end of the week (though I guess this blog would actually be a good space for it?). In fact, I might as well make the most of my momentum and set some intentions now!<br>
            But yes, of the resources I looked at, the two that most resonated with me were the pomodoro strategy, which spoke to my typically short millenial attention span, and the habit building theory by BJ Fogg. I really love the science and logic behind behaviour, so his approach really made a lot of sense to me.<br>
            It's hard to figure out how to break down the immense changes I would love to make into tiny and easily-digestible steps, but through the resources provided in the repo, I could see that a recurring message was to start small, so I guess EDA really values the process of breaking down that stuff, and I'd like to try it!<br>
            I think at the moment, some things I would really like to try are:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>After I drop my boyfriend off at work in the morning, I will meditate for 15 minutes</li>
                <li>While I eat my lunch, I will update my diary</li>
                <li>I will try the pomodoro method on Mondays when I am studying on campus, and at home when I am working on personal projects</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I think I'll keep it at that for now, I'm well versed with trying to start too many new habits at once!
        </p>
        <p>
            I also found the "Seven counterintuitive ways to be insanely productive" to be really reassuring and humanising; I really love the way it questions a lot of the conditioning I've been exposed to around work ethic and culture, and makes me feel a little less selfish and lazy for finding it hard to do things that I don't actually want to do, or working on someone else's schedule. The first proper job I had, straight out of university, saw me in a work environment I found incredibly challenging, stressful and ill-suited to my working style (not that I had really discovered it yet). I am still working to deconstruct a lot of the unhealthy self-expectations and perceptions that I developed in this job, and this article really spoke to me and encouraged me to discover and own a working method that works for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            To conclude, I'm excited!! Once again, I'm really impressed with the precision with which EDA leads me toward the tools and attitudes I need to succeed in this course - and in many other areas of life! So I'm feeling really thankful for that.
