            <h3>A hierarchy of happiness</h3>
            <p>
              Pleasure, Passion and Purpose. Three doorways to happiness. This was cool 
              to read as I often spend time observing and surrendering to my generation's 
              addiction to instant gratification (pleasure), and then end up pep talking 
              myself about how this addiction has been created by an absence of deeper 
              happiness (and is now just habitual :( ). Looking at it from a Purpose-down 
              perspective, this to me clearly sets people up for a healthier, more successful 
              and more integrated life. I have often wondered if the matter purpose sits at the base of 
              all happiness and unhappiness.

              <h3>Core Values</h3>
              <p>
                Wow. I think this is my favourite chapter so far. This stuff is so important. 
                I'm a very spiritual person, and see my time on earth as an opportunity 
                to grow: physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. So to me, new experiences 
                - both positive and negative - are deeply valued. So cultivating anf maintaining an open mind and 
                open heart are both really really important to me. I also think the world is really 
                fucking beautiful (excuse my french) on every level, and acknowledging and celebrating 
                that feels really important as well.

                <h3>What I stand for</h3>
                <p>
                  I care deeply for the state of the world and the people in it. This means that I 
                  am pretty highly invested in making it a good place to exist, and prepared to commit 
                  a significant amount of my time, energy and resources to helping this happen.<br>The way 
                  I see it, sooooo many of our problems and conflicts are caused by a combination
                  of</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>A lack of connection to ourselves</li>
                      <li>A lack of connection to others</li>
                      <li>A lack of connection to the earth</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                  So I feel like one of the most important things I can do in the world is to support 
                  and enable these forms of connection. And funnily enough, I <strong>LOVE</strong> doing 
                  this. Like it makes my heart soar. It 100% puts me into a state of flow, and doing the 
                  exercises from the book was what actually made me realise that. And it's been really 
                  great to sit with that and reflect on what is actually practically important to me.

                    <h3>Finding the strength to follow your dreams</h3>
                    <p>
                      As a generalisation, I think we live in a fear-based society. We are part of an 
                      economy that functions out of a scarcity-based mindset. And this teaches us to 
                      be conservative, to feel insecure, to second-guess ourselves. I have thoroughly 
                      enjoyed the journey of unlearning all of this, and realising how tangibly possible 
                      it actually is to chase all of our dreams. All of them! I started crafting 
                      a positive mindset at the age of 17 after reading <a href="https://www.thesecret.tv/products/the-secret-book/">
                      The Secret</a>. Because of my spiritual disposition I have been learning how to respond to all 
                      manner of emotions with curiosity and compassion for a wee while now. And for me inner 
                      calm is a matter of trust and acceptance, knowing that the both the rainy days and 
                      the sunny days will pass, and learning to stay in touch with the part of me that 
                      remains present through all of them.
