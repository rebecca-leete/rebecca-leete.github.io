            <h3>Process over Product</h3>
            <p>
              So in this sprint we were told <em>"focus on process over product"</em> which 
              really resonates with me in terms of judging the value of something based on 
              the process, effort and intention involved, rather than solely on the outcome. 
              Which I see as quite a common thought pattern in modern western society. Unfo
              rtunately I feel like I leaned more toward product than process when recreating 
              this site, as I am such a visual person. But the process wasn't too bad.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoyed getting my head around responsive design, which I think provided the biggest ch
              allenge for me, and I enjoyed pairing with fellow students and friends to work 
              through issues. I also now understand how easy and tempting it is to cover up 
              scrappy code with more code (eek!), and suspect I did a bit of that... But yes, 
              in the end I think I followed a process sort of like:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <strong>
              <li class="horizontal">1. Wireframe</li>
              <li class="horizontal">2. Grid design</li>
              <li class="horizontal">3. Responsive design</li>
              <li class="horizontal">4. Adding content</li>
              <li class="horizontal">5. Polishing</li>
              </strong> 
            </ol>
            <p>
              Which felt good to me, and seemed to work well as a way of doing things in 
              the right order and getting the foundations set first.

            <h3>Meditation</h3>
            <p>
              I've been meditating on and off since I was about 18. I first got into it 
              because I liked what it added to my self-image. Ha ha. And I found it really 
              hard. Impossible. My understanding of successful meditation was complete mental 
              silence, but as time has gone on I've learnt that actually, there is no right or 
              wrong way to mediate, and felt like this was really nicely reaffirmed in <a href="http://siybook.com/">Chapter 2</a>
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              I used to notice a thought come into my head, and notice myself noticing it, 
              and notice myself noticing myself notice it, and berate myself for breaking those 
              3 seconds of quiet, and just generally feeling like a very untalented meditator. So the 
              best thing about this chapter was the reassurance that actually, this is totally 
              ok, and part of the process. It's not about using an enormous amount of will to 
              achieve nirvana straight away. It's about slowly and gently exercising that attention 
              span, and meta-attention span. So I feel rather encouraged to continue now, knowing 
              that I'm doing a good job no matter what :)
            </p>
