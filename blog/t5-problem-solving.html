            <h3>Getting through the block</h3>
            <p>
              There are many, many times I've ended up stuck in this sprint. I wasn't able 
              to solve any of the exercises from <em>Eloquent Javascript</em> without looking 
              at the answers. At this stage, to be honest, I don't feel like my grasp on Javascript 
              is comprehensive enough to even <em>be</em> problem solving, because I don't really 
              understand what I'm supposed to be doing in the first place. That's where I find 
              pseudocoding really coming in handy. Often when I'm trying to lay out the steps to 
              take in any challenge or project in life, my first step is to write it all down with 
              some sort of basic structure - like journalling, it helps me to be able to focus on the 
              bigger picture all at once.<br><br>
              I'm definitely not feeling confident, and I think I've told myself this story that I'm 
              imcompetent because I'm struggling so much with even the simplest exercises, and there 
              have definitely been moments of deep frustration and complete helplessness. In saying 
              all of this, however, by the end of the last exercise I felt like I was in a better state 
              of flow, and felt like I understood what I was supposed to be creating, and the 
              sense of delight and satisfaction that comes from getting something to work without looking 
              at the answers is worth all the grind!<br><br>
              There's a lot of learning invlved in this process. Technically, I'm understanding 
              the structure of javascript a lot better, and how all the different elements fit together 
              and what each of them does. But more importantly I'm learning patience. Patience to not 
              base my success in getting it perfect the first time, and patience in the fact that 
              actually, it's not that important that I DO understand it all now, and trusting that 
              it's all going to come together at the right time later down the track.

              <h3>What are my strategies like?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong><br>Feels great. Its suits my style of thinking 
                  and learning, and gives me a record of how I was thinking prior to solving 
                  the problem, which helps me to see how I need to improve my approaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Trying something</strong><br>Yup this is good too, often my first 
                  step actually, just blindly throwing some code at the console haha. It's easy 
                  to do and gives me at least something to work with, instead of staring at a blank screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Rubber Ducky method</strong><br>Haven't actually tried this one yet. 
                  I know I should because it will help me clarify what I need to be doing, and 
                  highlight the parts I understand well and don't understand well. But hasn't happened yet</li>
                <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong><br>Haven't tried this one either. Or maybe 
                  I have. I don't think I found it very helpful because I often didn't understand what 
                  it was referring to!</li>
                <li><strong>Console.logging</strong><br>Haven't reeeeally tried this one either. It 
                  took me a while to get used to dev tools (but once I did they were great!!), and I 
                  suspect it will be the same for console logging. I know it's a great tool but I don't 
                  feel comfortable using it yet.</li>
                <li><strong>Googling</strong><br>Yep, real easy to go to. However I don't understand 
                  much of what the responses are in the online forums the queries are often posted on, 
                  so I've noticed myself relying on it less and less.</li>
                <li><strong>Asking peers</strong><br>Yeah I like doing this. It feels best to get a 
                  response from someone that has likely been through a very similar learning curve 
                  recently, as I feel like they are in the best position to understand what I am stuck 
                  on and what I need to know, and be able to communicate it with good speed and language.</li>
                <li><strong>Asking coaches</strong><br>I haven't really felt like I've got to a stage where 
                  I've exhausted my options enough to go to the coaches for help which is great, but 
                  it's nice to know that I have a safety net I can really rely on if I really really need it!</li>
                <li><strong>Improving process with reflection</strong><br>Yeah I very instinctively see the 
                  value in this, and if I've just finished learning an entire process or exercise, I'll 
                  often try and write the whole thing down from my head just to make sure it's settled in my brain properly.</li>
