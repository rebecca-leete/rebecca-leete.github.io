            <h3>Mindfulness vs Self-awareness</h3>
            <p>
              I can absolutely understand the parallel drawn between mindfulness and 
              self-awareness. They are both describing the practice of paying attention 
              to the traffic of your mind and heart without judgement. Judgement tends 
              to dissolve the clarity that comes with neutral observation, I find. I 
              feel like self-awareness is almost the next level of mindfulness - like 
              self-awareness is sustained mindfulness held in an embedded state of mind.

              <h3>Journalling: the emotional coder's equivalent of pseudocoding</h3>
              <p>
                I have been journalling since the beginning of hig school as a wee 14 
                year-old, and I would without a doubt attribute a huge amount of my 
                intrapersonal relationship to this practice. For me it's like... Having 
                a concrete record of my train of thought, and somehow this seems to inherently 
                create a wonderful amount of clarity. I solve so many problem just through 
                the act of writing them down. It's kind of like pseudocoding in this way, 
                and just provides a space where you can explore and process what is happening 
                in life and inside without any fear of it actually creating any external impacts.<br>
                I haven't done consistent journalling in a while, but reading about the statistical 
                benefits really encourages and reminds me to get back into it!

                <h3>Me myself and My Emotions</h3>
                <p>
                  I love the idea of stepping back from our emotions. I first heard about 
                  it in Buddhist lore, I think. However I think it's important to be careful 
                  with how we approach our emotions, because I think "process" can often be 
                  the very thing that <em>stops</em> us from processing our emotions. I find 
                  that if I take too much of a systemic approach to dealing with how I'm feeling 
                  often pulls me into my head and has me intellectualising my emotions, which 
                  in turn stops them from being "digested" in a healthy way. I can totally 
                  empathise with this because there are a lot of emotions that are really raw 
                  and difficult to confront honestly, but it's definitely definitely better 
                  in the long run.<br><br>
                  My approach to my emotions is similar though, in 
                  the way that I don't identify with them, but I go a step further and make 
                  sure I still honour them. I try acknowledge what I'm feeling, with as little 
                  resistance as possible, and to hold space for it in the most instinctive 
                  and non-structured way possible. This allows me to fully process what I'm 
                  feeling without identifying with it, which in turn creates an excellent 
                  vantage point for observing what has caused, shaped and interacted with these 
                  feelings on a much deeper level. Being able to reach such insights into my 
                  own human behaviour allows me to recognise similar patterns in others, and 
                  enhances my sense of empathy and interbeing.<br><br>Yeah, I love this stuff.
