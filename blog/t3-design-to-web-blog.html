            <h3>Responsive sites re-visited</h3>
            <p>
              We touched on repsonsive websites in the <a href="./t2-html-css-dom-p2.html">last blog post</a>, 
              talking about how it's important to have a webpage that can be re-sized 
              for different screen sizes. It provides pages that are easy and intuitive 
              to navigate, quick to load, and they're designed to look great! This can 
              make or break a site in terms of traffic and engagement - never underestimate 
              ease-of-use as a tool for success!
            </p>
            <h3>Mobile-first Design</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/">Apparently</a> over half 
              of all the internet traffic worldwide now happens via mobile devices. That's huge, and 
              it's only increasing. Having websites that cater to mobile device screens and interfac
              es are more important than ever, and will make a huge difference to who interacts with 
              your site and how. Mobile-first design just means designing your site first and foremost 
              for a mobile screen, and expanding from there for other sizes. It is much simpler and 
              easier to design for a smaller screen first and "expand" that design for bigger screens 
               than it is to try and collapse a page initially designed for larger screens.
            </p>
            <h3>Frameworks</h3>
            <p>
              Frameworks! Ah! So handy and helpful! Frameworks are these wonderful things people have 
              designed to take (some of) the tedious parts out of building a website. It's kind of like 
              doing a colour-by-number rather than doing a full painting from scratch. Frameworks vary 
              in complexity from providing very simple or minimal frames for front-end design, <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">like Skeleton</a>, 
              to vast frames including a huge variety of features for design, function and databases, 
              <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">like Ruby on Rails</a>. They're great in the way that 
              they can make web design much easier and more streamlined, but the downside is that it 
              limits your understanding of how your website is built and behaves, and if something goes 
              wrong, it's a lot of unfamiliar code to sort through in order to find the bug.
            </p>
            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Wireframes are fun, they're the pages of scribbled squares that pile up right at the start 
              the web design process. We looked at <a href="./t2-html-css-dom-p1.html">boxified design</a> 
              and <a href="./t2-html-css-dom-p2.html">grid-based design</a> earlier, and wireframes are the 
              visual representation of this design process. It's often quite difficult to keep the countless 
              boxes-witin-boxes-within-boxes in our head, so spacing it out on paper ensures all of your divs, 
              rows and columns. and the content within it, is going to fit together smoothly.
