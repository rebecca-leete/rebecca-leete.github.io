            <h3>Checking In on Mindfulness Practices</h3>
            <p>
              So I actually already do a daily practice of answering a series of questions 
              I have set myself for personal reflection and habit building. It's amazing! 
              You should all do it! And actually the first of my questions is <em>"Did you 
              spend 15 minutes of peaceful silent time with yourself?"</em> Doing this reflective practice  
              with a other person is doubly effective - there is something about that external 
              accountability that I personally find more motivating.<br><br>Having someone you can 
              check in with weekly or daily is beneficial for any habit-building, as it
              gives you the space to be able to reflect on what you feel like you're doing well 
              and not doing well, and whether it's helpful and purposeful or not.
