            <h3>Checking In on Mindfulness Practices</h3>
            <p>
              So I actually already do a daily practice of answering a series of questions 
              I have set myself for personal reflection and habit building. It's amazing! 
              You should all do it! And actually the first of my questions is <em>"Did you 
              spend 15 minutes of peaceful silent time with yourself?"</em> Doing this reflective practice  
              with a other person is doubly effective - there is something about that external 
              accountability that I personally find more motivating.<br><br>Having someone you can 
              check in with weekly or daily is beneficial for any habit-building, as it
              gives you the space to be able to reflect on what you feel like you're doing well 
              and not doing well, and whether it's helpful and purposeful or not.
            </p>

            <h3>Keeping the Momentum Going</h3>
            <p>
              Out of the three suggested techniques for maintaning my mindfulness practice, 
              I guess I am already doing the first one (<em>"Have a buddy"</em>). I find talking 
              about it often keeps it on top of my mind, and easier to put into practice during 
              everyday life. I also like the idea of <em>"One breath a day"</em>, as it relates 
              well to the BJ Fogg method we have <a href="./t1-time-and-habits-blog.html">already 
              looked at</a>, through minimising the task to the extent that it is ultra-achieveable!<br><br>
              Aside from that, I actually really enjoy practising mindfulness when I am gardening, 
              which I do a couple times weekly at the moment. I find it really good to link the 
              habit to a task I already do (just like Fogg says!).

            <h3>A Very Important P.S.</h3>
            <p>
              The most fascinating and beneficial thing I am getting from reading <a href="http://siybook.com/">Search Inside Yourself</a> 
              is most definitely the way it disarms failure. Failure is a concept that creates massive 
              mental and emotional blocks for many people - myself absolutely included - and this book 
              does a really good job of looking at what we assume failure and success are, and 
              actually taking the time to redefine them appropriately. I have spent a good amount of 
              my life basing my "success" value on my ability to get things right the first time, or 
              in a short amount of time. This book has taught me that, actually no, success is based 
              on accepting the first-time failure as a very normal and natural thing, and focussing 
              on how you respond to that. In mindfulness, that translates to bringing my attention back 
              to my breath when it wanders. In coding, that translates to looking at the dishevelled broken 
              code I have just written, and understanding how to fix it. This has been HUGE! It has the 
              power to completely transform my self-image and self-worth, as well as transforming the 
              way I choose to engage with challenges and setbacks. I could go on and on about this, 
              because it really is so revelatory for me. So yes! Thank you Chade-Meng Tan!
