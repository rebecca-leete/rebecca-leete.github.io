          Searching Inside Myself
        </h3>
        <p class="page-content">
          Emotional intelligence is real. It's a huge tool that, relating to the 
          five domains defined at the start of the chapter, I have been using in
          tuitively for a long time. I developed a high emotional and social sen
          sitivity as a teenager while I was trying to figure out how to fit int
          o the high school hierarchy, and while spending a lot of time journall
          ing, which I find is the ideal process for me to pause and process eve
          rything that is internally and externally happening to me.

          It's cool! It's really amazing! I find human behaviour so fasc
          inating! I really believe in the value of a relationship-based work culture. 
          I have seen firsthand how powerful it can be, and I know emotional intelli
          gence is the powerhouse behind that. I really loved the physiological and 
          cognitive breakdown of what happens is the brain and body as it complimen
          ted my intuitive knowledge really well.

        <h3 class="centertext">Being Mindful of my Body</h3>
        <p class="page-content">
          I have dabbled in meditation and mindfulness before, but I have never 
          heard about "high resolution perception" or the function of the amygdala. 
          As someone who experiences anxiety from time to time the idea of increasing 
          my awareness of the physical sensations connected to my emotions and being 
          able to manage how I feel based on my body is really intriguing to me. I e
          nded up doing 20 minutes of mindfulness, but it was right before bed and I 
          was pretty tired, so I found myself very distracted and not present, but I'
          m eager and motivated to continue this process and see how I develop from it.
