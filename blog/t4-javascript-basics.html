            <h3>Javascript compared to HTML & CSS</h3>
            <p>
              Wow! I finally hit javascript! Or, really, it hit <em>me</em>. It's an 
              interesting one, and as such an intuitive thinker I found it waaay harder 
              to get my head around. I haven't done maths like that since NCEA level 2. It 
              feels much more like I'm speaking directly to a computer than html or css, 
              which I guess makes sense given the increased level of involvement between the computer 
              and the commands I'm writing. I guess the main difference I see is that html and 
              css languages are mostly descriptive in nature, whereas js is strictly logic and 
              mathematics.
            </p>
            <h3>Flow and loops</h3>
            <p>
              Control flow is a process that regulates the performance of a certain action or set 
              of actions depending on the conditions of a situation before, during and after it 
              plays out.<br><br>
              Following? Probably not.<br><br>
              Let's look at it this way:<br>
              Think about having to refuel your car. Before you can do 
              anything, you have to check: does my car need re-fuelling? (that's assessing the 
              situation.) If your car has enough petrol, the conditions are not met for the action 
              of refuelling your car to take place. If your car doesn't have enough petrol, you 
              perform that action, until there is enough petrol in your car, and then you stop. 
              And then when the conditions are right once again for your car to be refuelled (when it 
              is empty), the process will be repeated all over again.<br>
              I hope that makes more sense...
            </p>
            <p>
              Actually I think I've managed to merge control flow and looping into one 
              example there... So just to clarify:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Control flow</strong> is the process of assessing a situation and deciding what 
                  action to take based on the conditions of a situation: refuel car <strong>if</strong>
                   (car is empty); <strong>else</strong> (continue driving your car);
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Looping</strong> is the process of repeating an action until you reach a 
                  defined situation: <strong>repeat</strong> pumping petrol into your car <strong>until</strong>
                   the tank is full of petrol.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Getting into Arrays and Objects</h3>
              <p>
                Arrays and objects are both ways to store data. There's multiple data forms 
                such as numbers, strings (this is javascript for you - it defines a "word" as a 
                connected string of characters. Why can't it just be a word.), boolean (true or 
                false data), etc. <br><br>
                The difference between the two is that data stored in an array is in the 
                form of a series of ordered values, one after the other. To access that data 
                you have to refer to a certain position within that series.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  EG. Here is your array: [2, 4, 6, 8], and if you wanted to access say, the 
                  number 6, you have to refer to it's place in the array (remembering computers 
                  start counting from 0, not 1). So your request would involve something like: array[2].
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Objects, on the other hand, store data in pairs, one part being the "key" and the 
                other being the "value." It's kind of like labelling.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  So here, imagine we had an object resembling a flower. Its data could 
                  be formatted like:<br><strong>"Name": "buttercup";<br>"Petals": 5;<br>"Leaves": 2;<br>"Stem": 
                  1;<br>"Colour": "yellow";</strong><br>Where the first part of the pair is the key, and the second 
                  is the value. To access any of the values in an object, you have to refer to the key.<br>Phew!
                </li>
              </ul>
