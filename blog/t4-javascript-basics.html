            <h3>Javascript compared to HTML & CSS</h3>
            <p>
              Wow! I finally hit javascript! Or, really, it hit <em>me</em>. It's an 
              interesting one, and as such an intuitive thinker I found it waaay harder 
              to get my head around. I haven't done maths like that since NCEA level 2. It 
              feels much more like I'm speaking directly to a computer than html or css, 
              which I guess makes sense given the increased level of involvement between the computer 
              and the commands I'm writing. I guess the main difference I see is that html and 
              css languages are mostly descriptive in nature, whereas js is strictly logic and 
              mathematics.

            <h3>Flow and loops</h3>
            <p>
              Control flow is a process that regulates the performance of a certain action or set 
              of actions depending on the conditions of a situation before, during and after it 
              plays out.<br><br>
              Following? Probably not.<br><br>
              Let's look at it this way:<br>
              Think about having to refuel your car. Before you can do 
              anything, you have to check: does my car need re-fuelling? (that's assessing the 
              situation.) If your car has enough petrol, the conditions are not met for the action 
              of refuelling your car to take place. If your car doesn't have enough petrol, you 
              perform that action, until there is enough petrol in your car, and then you stop. 
              And then when the conditions are right once again for your car to be refuelled (when it 
              is empty), the process will be repeated all over again.<br>
              I hope that makes more sense...
            </p>
            <p>
              Actually I think I've managed to merge control flow and looping into one 
              example there... So just to clarify:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Control flow</strong> is the process of assessing a situation and deciding what 
                  action to take based on the conditions of a situation: refuel car <strong>if</strong>
                   (car is empty); <strong>else</strong> (continue driving your car);
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>looping</strong> is the process of repeating an action until you reach a 
                  defined situation: <strong>repeat</strong> pumping petrol into your car <strong>until</strong>
                   the tank is full of petrol.
                </li>
              </ul>
