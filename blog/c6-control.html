            <h3>Triggers</h3>
            <p>
              This is an interesting one, and something that is becoming rapidly more widely 
              recognised and accepted. I have seen people write or say "Trigger Warning" 
              before they share a story about sensitive issues - this could be rape, discrimination, 
              etc.<br>In code, I definitely notice my hairs raise when someone tells me how to do 
              something I already know how to do, or am already doing.<br> Using the Siberian North 
              Railroad, I noticed how quickly that fire dies down when I am looking at it from 
              the outside. I immediately shift into an empathetic mindset, and distinguish the 
              instructor's intentions from how I received them. As a rule, I try not to take other people's 
              outbursts personally and in return, try not to direct my emotions at others personally. 
              It's also been really good just to acknowledge that this is one of my triggers here, I 
              find that even just having the awareness of it being a sensitive point with me helps 
              me to have empathy for myself, knowing there is something deeper to be explored there.

              <h3>Some concerns put to rest</h3>
              <p>
                So after reading the last chapter (4) of Search Inside Yourself, I was a 
                bit worried that some of what they were suggesting - about not identifying 
                with your emotions - can sometimes be interpreted and acted on as an escape or 
                coping mechanism which leads to those feelings being repressed, rejected, or 
                demonized. For example, in the past I have definitely subscribed to a narrative 
                of all bad things stemming from my "ego", which led to an aspiration to defeat 
                destroy it. This sucked and it actually made my intrapersonal relationship way 
                more unhealthy. Learning to make peace with my monsters, rather than feeding them 
                or trying to fight them off or hating them when they're here, is something that 
                took me many years to learn, so I am excited to see it properly honoured in this chapter!
