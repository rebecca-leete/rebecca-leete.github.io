      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and DOM (Document Object Model)
      are all pretty key parts in putting together a web page. When I was a kid my mum used to get me these little wooden
      dinosaurs that I got to put together and paint, and they were awesome, I loved them. The ankylosaurus was my fave. 
      But the CSS, HTML and DOM create a webpage in the same way that I created these dinosaurs. When I opened the packet,
      I had a set of plain unassembled wooden pieces - arms, legs, heads, tails, etc - and a row of little paints. The HTML
      is like the plain wooden limbs: they make up the content of the toy, and contain everything you need for a fully-
      functional wooden dinosaur. The paints aren't strictly necessary, they're cosmetic, but they help a great deal in 
      making the dinosaur actually <em>look like</em> a dinosaur. And the DOM is the set of instructions that guides you how
      paint the little wooden pieces and slot them together so the arms and legs are in the right space. The end product 
      isn't guaranteed to look exactly like the instructions suggest - the browser may detect and correct an error in the DOM 
      in the same way mini-me might have noticed a typo or misprinted diagram in the instructions and been able to interpret 
      what the next step is. And also like mini-me, if the error in the DOM is too big or unrecognisable, you're just going 
      to end up with a broken or awkward dinosaur :(
