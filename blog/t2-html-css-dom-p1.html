    <h3 class="centertext">CSS, HTML and DOM walk into a bar...</h3>
        <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/IWwAAOSwzrxUy1au/s-l1600.jpg" alt="dinosaur" style="width:450px; height:450px;

      <p class="page-content">
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and DOM (Document Object Model)
        are all pretty key parts in putting together a web page. When I was a kid my mum used to get me these little wooden
        dinosaurs that I got to put together and paint, and they were awesome, I loved them. The ankylosaurus was my fave. 
        But the CSS, HTML and DOM create a webpage in the same way that I created these dinosaurs. When I opened the packet,
        I had a set of plain unassembled wooden pieces - arms, legs, heads, tails, etc - and a row of little paints. The HTML
        is like the plain wooden limbs: they make up the content of the toy, and contain everything you need for a fully-
        functional wooden dinosaur. The paints aren't strictly necessary, they're cosmetic, but they help a great deal in 
        making the dinosaur actually <em>look like</em> a dinosaur. And the DOM is the set of instructions that guides you how
        paint the little wooden pieces and slot them together so the arms and legs are in the right space. The end product 
        isn't guaranteed to look exactly like the instructions suggest - the browser may detect and correct an error in the DOM 
        in the same way mini-me might have noticed a typo or misprinted diagram in the instructions and been able to interpret 
        what the next step is. And also like mini-me, if the error in the DOM is too big or unrecognisable, you're just going 
        to end up with a broken or awkward dinosaur :(

    <h3 class="centertext">Boxifying Design</h3>
      <p class="page-content">
        Every webpage is made up of boxes. The way each element of the page fits together is in the form of boxes that are 
        either inside, outside or alongside each other. For example, the webpage itself is a box, and within that box is say, 
        a box containing the page header, and within that is a box for your page title, and a box for your nav - which is again 
        made up of many links or buttons each in their own box. <br>
        Understanding this design is super helpful in terms of designing and debugging page layout.
      </p>


    <h3 class="centertext">So what is the Box Model?</h3>
      <p class="page-content">
        The box model identifies the different kinds of "space" that are part of each html element, all of which ach of these 
        elements of the box model can be modified in different ways to manage and alter the layout of the webpage differently.<br>
        These areas are:<br>
      </p>  
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Content:</strong> the meat of the element, the actual content such as text or an image<br></li>
          <li><strong>Padding:</strong> the room between the content and the "box" it sits in<br></li>
          <li><strong>Border:</strong> the box that the content sits in, the edge of the space that belongs to the content<br></li>
          <li><strong>Margin:</strong> the space between boxes that house content<br></li>
        </ul>
